	p These are the key objectives as we understand them today:
	ul
		li Develop strategy and vision for the new Acme Co. employee portal - this vision must represent Acme Co.'s new mandate and focus
		li Socialize and align executive stakeholders around the vision and strategy

		| These imperatives will be supported by a collection of solution com-ponents as listed in the table below. The intranet is for the most part an enabler of the imperatives; it will not drive the imperatives directly per se. There exists a need for organizational change in parallel to this solution, to drive the business outcomes that are sought. For clar-ity, Habanero is NOT anticipating supporting this organizational change outside of delivering the solution.
